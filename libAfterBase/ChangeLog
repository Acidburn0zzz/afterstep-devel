		completed fixing old lib files to compensate for file relocation.
		There needs to be something done to Mkaefiles and configure to correctly set up

2001-04-18  sashav
		xcf image loading now works, but only gets you first layer with the same size as

		support for GIMP's xcf files

2001-04-12  sashav
		converted asfeel, backgrounds, mywidget, and others to use ScreenInfo.
		libafterstep and libasGUI now compiles clean, althou libasGUI will need to be
		cleaned up to use ASImage for most of the stuff instead of old pixmap based
		drawing.

2001-04-11  sashav
		converted mytexture.c to be multyscreen aware - althou when ASImage is
		done that will have to be switched to use ASImages instead of all the funky
		Pixmap stuff.
		GetColor is no longer needed, GetShadow and GetHilite moved to
		mystyles.c - get rid of lib/getcolor.c

2001-04-10  sashav
		multihead support work in progress - colors are internally stored as 32bit ARGB values.
		and converted to pixels based on each screen - need to add GC creation code to
		ScreenInfo code. parse_argb_color is implemented and should be used
		instead of XParseColor.

2001-03-22  sashav
		added timeouts to asetroot for displaying window; added
		flush_wmprops_data to remove specifyed properties - updated
		asetroot to use it. fixed rather nasty bug in asvector causing
		memory corruption in modules code; Fixed error handling in LoadImage

2001-03-21  sashav
		Updated asetroot to use ASWMProps for background property reading/writing.
		Added even handler to wmprops.c to handle property change events for root
		and selection windows - need to do the same for client properties as well ( maybe?) .

		Added set_client_names and set_client_hints to clientprops.c for use by modules.
		Added set_text_property to facilitate conversion into UTF8 of text properties where
		needed.

		Fixed afterstep initialization to setup modules only after WMProps initialized.

2001-03-20  sashav
		fixed several memory corruption bugs in myicon_create, 
		mylook_init and ashash. Added flush_ashash_memory_pool to free
		up memory so that audit shows relevant data. added cleanup_mode
		to audit to disable invalid opointer reports (if needed)

		Fixed Cursor grabbing code to use correct cursor IDs.
		Fixed auditing code to not count memory cached in freed pool.
		Added destruction code for LayoutDef.
		Fixed default DecorLayouts to put things in the right places.
		Numerous fixes in LayoutDef generation code.
		Window decorations seems to be correct now.
		Added checks to several places in mystyles to check for non-zero pixmap size.
		There still is wierd bug in menuwindow causing X errors on menu close.

2001-03-19  sashav
		hmm, catching bugs in new layout code - making progress - AS now segfaults
		due to some obscure memory corruption. :)

2001-03-13  sashav
		Improved owsla's fix to counter bug - xdestroyimage should not really be
		deallocating NULL memory

2001-03-11  owsla
		Fixed bug that caused Total deallocs to be higher than Total allocs, this
		happened because count_find_and_extract() did not have an alternative if
		remove_hash_item() failed.

		Added a pretty line break in spool_unfreed_mem()

2001-03-06  sashav
		almost done with ornament layout generation code - smaller part of frame layout left.
		reverted ASHashKey back to unsigned short - when it was changed to unsigned int - no idea.

2001-02-22  sashav
		Fixed crashing bugs in aswindow.c(restack_window()) and
		Xmodule.c( My_XErrorHandler())
		Standardized titlebar resizing/respacing functions and now use it in both
		WMIcon and WMDecor.
		Fixed icons being black on second inocification - needed to resize layouts
		in fix_icon_size.
		Icon title now is drawn not smaller then icon itself.

2001-02-15  sashav
		Completed implementation of function validation in asfeel.c;
		Fixed cursor grabbing in ExecuteComplexFunction to use
		actuall cursor ID instead on number.
		Supposedly got icon mapping/unmapping right this time.
		Iconification/deiconification actually works now, but fails on reentry -
		i.e. iconify->deiconify->iconify - needs some more debugging.
		Fixed memory corruption in winlist menu.

2001-02-14  sashav
		playing with mywmicon and widgets.
		Implmented event bubbling up to higher level widgets if not handled by a widget.

		Windows are now decorated and destroyed correctly. Multiple reparenting/
		messaging/destruction bugs fixed. Placement fixed when window is decorated
		after AS startup and is using USPosition.
		Menus needs some debugging.

		event debugging

2001-01-30  sashav
		Added mystrdup/mystrndup to memory audit code, since they are
		so generic; Fixed memory leaks in asdatabase.c(match_list),
		Feel.c(key binding and EdgeScroll), CaptureAllWindows (
		read_32prop_list), few other places. Implemented cleanup
		procedures for all the static data (aswindows.c, clientprops.c
		 modules.c, wmprops.c,mystyles.c); Fixed workspace session
		saving code to correctly recognize and workaround geometry. 
		AfterSTep has no visible memory leaks as of now.

2001-01-29  sashav
		Changed memory audit to use hash tables instead of linked list
		- its blazing fast now. Added add_hash_item to memory audit
		recognizeable functions - makes it much more usefull. Need to
		do the same for strdup functions.

2001-01-28  sashav
		Drawing in spaces between titlebar and client is fixed - new
		option BorderColor has to be added to MyStyles. Several memory
		leaks fixed - in menus, destruction of disabled elements in
		mywidgets, etc.

2001-01-26  sashav
		nailed down this memory corruption bug - VECTOR_TAIL was not
		working very good - forgot to multiply by unit size. Now lets
		fnd out with this huge number of pipes in linux 2.4 - 1024 -
		event loop has to be rewritten to yield sufficient performance there

2001-01-25  sashav
		Fixed initial placement of clients; Fixed initial layer. Fixed
		X errors on initial feel load;

		Side/lowbar is now appearing. Manhunt is underway for some nasty memory leak bug

		of the window state properties as per Gnome and ExtWM specs.
		Added change_window_state() to aswindow.c to provide unified interface to changing
		window status.
		Moved Reparent/Map/UnmapIt to aswindow.c and renamed them to be
		reparent_window, map_window, unmap_window - seems to be more consistent.
		Updated hints and clientprops to latest ExtWM specs -
		ICON_NAME and SKIP_PAGER added.
		Started cleaning up events.c

2001-01-10  sashav

		asproperty is gone and code is consolidated with xprop.c/.h

		some more afterstep.c cleanup.
		Added set_as_module_socket to wmprops.c
		Removed get_virtual_root from Xmodule.c - should use wmprops now.

		Gort rid of CatString3 and CopyString.
		Implemented MakeSessionDataFile to build filenames of icons, etc. in ASCP.

		Added automated check for -V command line parameter to ASModule.c for use
		by modules

2000-12-27  sashav

		Some new basic ASWindow evelopment

2000-12-13  sashav
		dynamic_buffer changed to ASVector with the goal to make
		it more general purpose and use in different places. Started work on ASWindowList

2000-12-12  sashav

		completely implemented new ASFeel utilization. Still needs work to implement autoexec
		execution. Got rid of all the old config reading crap

2000-11-16  sashav
		Keyboard and Mouse bindings fixin. There could be several bindings for the same
		context for the single control - but with different mods. That forces us to alter
		algorithm used previously. But indeed it turned out to be more memory intensive,
		but easier to code approach.
