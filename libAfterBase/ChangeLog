	* implemented protocol for clients to request root background for
	  any particular desktop; Enabled Pager to set its background to
	  the actuall desktop background's scaled copy; Fixed bug in
	  setting  atom list property - all the WM_PROTOCOLS are now set
	  properly

2002-12-18   -0500

	* implemented somewhat correct root background management scheme -
	  needs to be tried with multiple backgrounds switching;
	  implemented root background scaling and padding; added
	  ConfigureNotify prehandling prior to desktop switching so to get
	  everything reparented in correct position;

	  Solaris
	     boxes: 8bpp root window, with 24bpp possible to afterstep;
	  note that
	     asetroot still does not support this situation, so
	  transparency modes
	     do not work
	   o moved around audit.h includes to allow AS to be compiled with
	     --enable-audit again

2002-05-19   -0400

2001-09-18   -0400

	* Added Event handling to extract event class/mask window uniformly
	  ( collected code from trace.h, mywidget.h, eventloop.h ) Rewrote
	  widget reshaping. Dropped stacking order - parts pointers should
	  represent stacking order.  Added default handler for
	  ConfigureNotify for widgets Implemented context search of pointer
	  events.

2001-09-14   -0400

	* Implemented  widget's layout re-layouting and started working on
	  event handling.  Fixed several bugs in layout.c and added few

2001-08-31   -0400

	* moved ascp into libAfterConf and begun work on getting it fixed
	  for recent changes to libAfterSTep/Image. Fixed main.c and lib.c
	* Moved more size/layout management code into layout.c
	* Moved most of the layout functionality into the  libAfterBase and
	  untied it from the MyWidgets Supposedly we don't really need
	  generic MyWidgets - more of ready to use widgets.  generic
	  layouting and rendering has been moved out of it now, we pretty
	  much get stripped down things to the level where its no longer
	  usefull in its generic form.

2001-08-29   -0400

	* Implemented AS customized geometry parsing function; Added stub
	  for XParseGeometry; Fixe astile and asscale to compile without X

	  SHOW_TIME and START_TIME macros to libAfterBase

2001-07-10   -0400

	* updated Makefile to install include files as well
	* fixed configure in libAfterImage to have separate enablers for
	  static and shared libs

2001-07-09   -0400

	* Fixed parse_argb_color.  Added options to astile and asflip for
	  easier operation.  Fixed asgrad to treat gradient type well, if
	  gradient is not specified.  Added few more points to asgrad
	  sample gradient to create better illusion of the rainbow.

2001-07-07   -0400

	* fixed parse_argb_color to check for dpy not being NULL - to avoid
	  segfaults, babe

2001-07-05   -0400

	* Reimplemented image output to allow for flexible support for many
	  image formats - right now it could be ASImage itself, XImage,
	  mask XImage and  ARGB32.  Surprisingly that simplified code quite
	  abit.  Fixed ugly bug in create_asimage.  Completed and debugged
	  astext tutorial.

2001-06-21   -0400

	* change show_system_error() output based on `man perror`

2001-06-19   -0400

	* Implemented ARGB->pixel conversion for 32 and 24 bit True color
	  visual Fixed parse_argb_color to correctly treat 12 digit color
	  value as 48bit RGB.  More libAfterImage documenting
	* Fixed bug in find_file preventing it from finding files when not
	  NULL search path is specified.  Fixed bug in asimage2pixmap
	  causing it to use wrong gc variable.	Added more documentation to
	  asimage.h and respectively to asimage.html

	* completed flip-flopping code.  Added show_debug to show_* series
	  in libAfterBase/output.c started working on collor allocation on
	  PseudoColor visuals

2001-06-12   -0400

	* completed implementation of image alpha beveling.  completed
	  implementation of image flipping - need some cleanup thou to
	  allow for tiling.

2001-06-11   -0400

	* fixed configure to produce correct dependencies
	*  fixed configure to correctly create dependacy info
	* no message
	* Hopefully fixed memory allocations audit on libAfterBase.

2001-06-10   -0400

	*  added configclean target to the top level makefile; fixed
	  libraries makefiles to correctly generate .depend files
	*  fixed configure scripts to not do extra checks when invoked from
	  one another
	* typo fix in make_file_name

2001-06-08   -0400

	* configure fixes
	* rebuilt configure scripts

2001-06-07   -0400

	* hopefully fixed main configure script to gracefully handle
	  libraries configuration as well. MOved configure.h and some other
	  headers into include dir, so it could be used by modules
	* Fixed MyName requests in selfdiag.c; Added xpm.c to implement
	  custom xpm handling code - appears to be rather simple and
	  effective.  Most of the things are implemented, except for top
	  level routine.

2001-06-06   -0400

	* cleaned configure script for libafterimage. added afterimage-libs
	  script to print list of LD_FLAGS for linking with libafterimage

2001-06-05   -0400

	* fixed 50% of libAfterStep files to compile.  added functions.c to
	  hold all the function processing miscelanea cleaned up includes
	  on the way.
	* Aggregated module library code into ASmodule.c  - soon to be
	  renamed into module.c.  readaspacket.c, Xmodule.c are now gone.
	  Rewritten packet reading code to use socket_* interface from
	  libAfterBase, with correct endiannes handling of the data - need
	  to fix src/afterstep/module.c too, and maybe move some code from
	  there into libAfterStep/module.c.

2001-06-04   -0400

	* started documenting libAfterImage
	* updated the .cvsignore files

2001-06-03   -0400

	* sorted out compilation problems, and test now builds with new
	  libAfterImage

2001-06-02   -0400

	* got libAfterImage to compile

2001-06-01   -0400

	* hopefully resolved libAfterImage dependancy on libAfterBase

2001-05-31   -0400

	* forgot to add socket files
	* Implemented libAfterBase/socket.c to perform all the network
	  communication stuff. It implements socket setup, buffered writes
	  of int and string data, effective protocol implementation for
	  non-blocking reading.

2001-05-30   -0400

	* fixed configure scripts to correctly compile everything
	* Prototyped ASRenderer interface
	* completed fixing old lib files to compensate for file relocation.
	  There needs to be something done to Mkaefiles and configure to
	  correctly set up include paths and libraries.

2001-05-29   -0400

	* added output.c to libAfterImage to do all the show_* stuff. added
	  astype.h to define all the basic types fixed most of the files to
	  compile

2001-05-28   -0400

	* post relocation cleanup in process - several things merged
	  together into fs.c and os.c
	* updated to reflect location change

2001-05-27   -0400

	* Created prototype for the new library structure - libAfterBase.
	  There will be two more libraries : libAfterImage and
	  libAfterStep. This is to split generic and non-generic code and
	  allow for libraries to be used separately  - as a preparation for
	  libAfterImage release as a stand-alone library.)

2001-05-23   -0400

	* Updated FSF snail mail address.

2001-05-07   -0400

	* fixed create_screen_window for InputOnly windows fixed bug in
	  screen initialization where Colormap ID would get lost fixed bug
	  in desktop creation code where desktop->scr would never get
	  initialized.	Added show_progress function to work similarly to
	  show_warning/error Rearranged thresholds for output verbosity
	  Added stdargs.h  to import.c - suggested by Sean Dague

2001-04-18   -0400

	* xcf image loading now works, but only gets you first layer with
	  the same size as whole image. Need to implement layers merging
	  for ASImages to get complete support for GIMP's xcf files

2001-04-12   -0400

	* converted asfeel, backgrounds, mywidget, and others to use
	  ScreenInfo.  libafterstep and libasGUI now compiles clean, althou
	  libasGUI will need to be cleaned up to use ASImage for most of
	  the stuff instead of old pixmap based drawing.

2001-04-11   -0400

	* converted mytexture.c to be multyscreen aware - althou when
	  ASImage is done that will have to be switched to use ASImages
	  instead of all the funky Pixmap stuff.  GetColor is no longer
	  needed, GetShadow and GetHilite moved to mystyles.c - get rid of
	  lib/getcolor.c

2001-04-10   -0400

	* multihead support work in progress - colors are internally stored
	  as 32bit ARGB values.  and converted to pixels based on each
	  screen - need to add GC creation code to ScreenInfo code.
	  parse_argb_color is implemented and should be used instead of
	  XParseColor.

2001-03-21   -0500

	* added timeouts to asetroot for displaying window; added
	  flush_wmprops_data to remove specifyed properties - updated
	  asetroot to use it. fixed rather nasty bug in asvector causing
	  memory corruption in modules code; Fixed error handling in
	  LoadImage
	* Fixed module connection code to corrently use WMProps to get
	  socket filename.  Fixed afterstep initialization to setup modules
	  only after WMProps initialized.
	* Updated asetroot to use ASWMProps for background property
	  reading/writing.  Added even handler to wmprops.c to handle
	  property change events for root and selection windows - need to
	  do the same for client properties as well ( maybe?) .  Added
	  set_as_background to wmprops.c for asetroot to use.  Added
	  set_client_names and set_client_hints to clientprops.c for use by
	  modules.  Added set_text_property to facilitate conversion into
	  UTF8 of text properties where needed.  Added encode_atom_list to
	  allow for easy translation from bitset into atom list.  Updated
	  asetroot to use new set_client_* functions for hints. ( it now is
	  Extended WM specs compliant as needed).

2001-03-20   -0500

	* Fixed Cursor grabbing code to use correct cursor IDs.  Fixed
	  auditing code to not count memory cached in freed pool.  Added
	  destruction code for LayoutDef.  Fixed default DecorLayouts to
	  put things in the right places.  Numerous fixes in LayoutDef
	  generation code.  Window decorations seems to be correct now.
	  Added checks to several places in mystyles to check for non-zero
	  pixmap size.	There still is wierd bug in menuwindow causing X
	  errors on menu close.

2001-03-19   -0500

	* fixed several memory corruption bugs in myicon_create,
	  mylook_init and ashash. Added flush_ashash_memory_pool to free up
	  memory so that audit shows relevant data. added cleanup_mode to
	  audit to disable invalid opointer reports (if needed)
	* hmm, catching bugs in new layout code - making progress - AS now
	  segfaults due to some obscure memory corruption. :)

2001-03-13   -0500

	* Improved owsla's fix to counter bug - xdestroyimage should not
	  really be deallocating NULL memory

2001-03-11   -0500

	* Fixed bug that caused Total deallocs to be higher than Total
	  allocs, this happened because count_find_and_extract() did not
	  have an alternative if remove_hash_item() failed.
	* Added a pretty line break in spool_unfreed_mem()

2001-03-08   -0500

	* no message

2001-03-06   -0500

	* almost done with ornament layout generation code - smaller part
	  of frame layout left.  reverted ASHashKey back to unsigned short
	  - when it was changed to unsigned int - no idea.

2001-02-22   -0500

	* Fixed crashing bugs in aswindow.c(restack_window()) and
	  Xmodule.c( My_XErrorHandler()) Standardized titlebar
	  resizing/respacing functions and now use it in both WMIcon and
	  WMDecor.  Fixed icons being black on second inocification -
	  needed to resize layouts in fix_icon_size.  Icon title now is
	  drawn not smaller then icon itself.

2001-02-15   -0500

	* Completed implementation of function validation in asfeel.c;
	  Fixed cursor grabbing in ExecuteComplexFunction to use actuall
	  cursor ID instead on number.	Supposedly got icon
	  mapping/unmapping right this time.  Iconification/deiconification
	  actually works now, but fails on reentry - i.e.
	  iconify->deiconify->iconify - needs some more debugging.  Fixed
	  memory corruption in winlist menu.

2001-02-14   -0500

	* playing with mywmicon and widgets.  Implmented event bubbling up
	  to higher level widgets if not handled by a widget.  Implemented
	  some memory conservation when allocating memory for
	  MyLayourElems.  Implemented memory preallocation caching for
	  ASHashItem.

2001-02-01   -0500

	* extensive debugging of window initial mapping and subsequent
	  withdrawal.  Windows are now decorated and destroyed correctly.
	  Multiple reparenting/ messaging/destruction bugs fixed. Placement
	  fixed when window is decorated after AS startup and is using
	  USPosition.  Menus needs some debugging.

2001-01-31   -0500

	* event debugging

2001-01-29   -0500

	* Added mystrdup/mystrndup to memory audit code, since they are so
	  generic; Fixed memory leaks in asdatabase.c(match_list),
	  Feel.c(key binding and EdgeScroll), CaptureAllWindows
	  (read_32prop_list), few other places. Implemented cleanup
	  procedures for all the static data (aswindows.c, clientprops.c,
	  modules.c, wmprops.c,mystyles.c); Fixed workspace session saving
	  code to correctly recognize and workaround geometry. AfterSTep
	  has no visible memory leaks as of now.

2001-01-28   -0500

	* Changed memory audit to use hash tables instead of linked list -
	  its blazing fast now. Added add_hash_item to memory audit
	  recognizeable functions - makes it much more usefull. Need to do
	  the same for strdup functions.

2001-01-27   -0500

	* Drawing in spaces between titlebar and client is fixed - new
	  option BorderColor has to be added to MyStyles. Several memory
	  leaks fixed - in menus, destruction of disabled elements in
	  mywidgets, etc.

2001-01-25   -0500

	* nailed down this memory corruption bug - VECTOR_TAIL was not
	  working very good - forgot to multiply by unit size. Now lets fnd
	  out with this huge number of pipes in linux 2.4 - 1024 - event
	  loop has to be rewritten to yield sufficient performance there
	* Side/lowbar is now appearing. Manhunt is underway for some nasty
	  memory leak bug causing memory allocations of some random (very
	  large) sizes.  Added print_mem_stats_info to audit.c to enable
	  output of short version of memory allocation status.

2001-01-24   -0500

	* Fixed initial placement of clients; Fixed initial layer. Fixed X
	  errors on initial feel load;
	* finally got frame decoration to draw - topmost frame was never
	  mapped.  improved abit decor initialization code to avoid
	  redundand calculations.  Fixed bug in afterstep main to change
	  desktop correctly when AS is restarted
	* updated debugging log
	* Fixed memory audition for new property reading/allocation
	  functions : XListProperties, XGetTextProperty, XAllocClassHint,
	  XAllocSizeHints; added LOCAL_DEBUG_CALLER_OUT macro to enable
	  runtime caller backtracing.

2001-01-20   -0500

	*  implemented ASHints serialization - need to implement
	  decerealization next.

2001-01-18   -0500

	* Implemeted Circulation/warping code.	Some more cleanup in
	  functions.c.

2001-01-16   -0500

	* Updated DeferExecution to use ASEvent and cleaned up a bit;
	  Changed ExecFunction to use ASEvent - still alot to do here.
	  Changed check_allowed_menu_func to use mask as an argument
	  instead of ASWindow pointer.	Fixed SaveOpenedWindows in
	  afterstep.c.	changed spawn_child to not add & at the end of
	  cmdline if requested to not fork.  Made KeyboardShortcuts to
	  compile.  Disabled most of the event handlers to not participate
	  in compile for now.  Fixed colormaps.c to use ASEvent.  Added
	  match_string_list to regexp.c.  Added pattern2ASWindow to
	  aswindow.c to facilitate pattern matching of window names.

2001-01-12   -0500

	* Got desktop.c to compile.  Added set_desktop_num_prop and
	  set_current_desk_prop to wmprops.c to facilitate updates of all
	  those pesky compatibility properties on root window.	Added
	  set_client_state and set_client_desk in clientprops.c to enable
	  update of the window state properties as per Gnome and ExtWM
	  specs.  Added change_window_state() to aswindow.c to provide
	  unified interface to changing window status.	Moved
	  Reparent/Map/UnmapIt to aswindow.c and renamed them to be
	  reparent_window, map_window, unmap_window - seems to be more
	  consistent.  Updated hints and clientprops to latest ExtWM specs
	  - ICON_NAME and SKIP_PAGER added.  Started cleaning up events.c

2001-01-09   -0500

	* fixed bug in hash table sorting, that was causing endless looping
	  and out-of-bounds memory access

2001-01-06   -0500

	* implemented singleton launcher in lib/asapp. Switched background
	  drawing and sound playing to use it.

2001-01-04   -0500

	* some more afterstep.c cleanup.  Added set_as_module_socket to
	  wmprops.c Removed get_virtual_root from Xmodule.c - should use
	  wmprops now.	minor cleanup of src/afterstep/module.c - needs way
	  more work.
	* implemented ASWMProps strructure and some essential reading
	  procedures.  asproperty is gone and code is consolidated with
	  xprop.c/.h

2001-01-03   -0500

	* implemented selections mechnismus.  Implemented some Window
	  Manager compatibility properties added property writing functions
	  to xprop.c

2001-01-02   -0500

	* added forgotten xprop.c to Makefile
	* some more development in afterstep.c - spawining children is
	  updated.  Rearranged hints/properties in libafterstep to allow
	  for more modular approach - properties on client windows are
	  separated from the properties on root window.  All the string
	  code consolidated into mystring.c.  Gort rid of CatString3 and
	  CopyString.  Implemented MakeSessionDataFile to build filenames
	  of icons, etc. in ASCP.

2000-12-28   -0500

	* Added automated check for -V command line parameter to ASModule.c
	  for use by modules

2000-12-27   -0500

	* completed session saving into file code - Window Maker sucks!
	  rearranged CaptureAllWindows.  add_window now allows to add
	  window based on its WM_STATE.

2000-12-26   -0500

	* fixed print_simple_backtrace to work around buggy gcc. Got rid of
	  wild.c - moved into regexp.c
	* Implemented show_error/warning and DEBUG_OUT/LOCAL_DEBUG_OUT.
	  Implemented stack backtracing from failed X calls without
	  signals.  Converted old code in libasGUI to use new output
	  routines.  Compilation problem fixed related to removal of
	  misc.h.

2000-12-21   -0500

	* ASVector developed and tested - seems to be working just fine.

2000-12-13   -0500

	* dynamic_buffer changed to ASVector with the goal to make it more
	  general purpose and use in different places. Started work on
	  ASWindowList

2000-12-11   -0500

	* completed transition to libasGUI. King is dead - Long Live The
	  King

2000-12-10   -0500

	  well

2000-11-17   -0500

	* completely implemented new ASFeel utilization. Still needs work
	  to implement autoexec execution. Got rid of all the old config
	  reading crap

2000-11-16   -0500

	* Keyboard and Mouse bindings fixin. There could be several
	  bindings for the same context for the single control - but with
	  different mods. That forces us to alter algorithm used
	  previously. But indeed it turned out to be more memory intensive,
	  but easier to code approach.

2000-11-13   -0500

	* Applying ASFeel to afterstep

2000-11-07   -0500

	  libafterstep Hopefully fixed look/feel changing and different
	  looks/feels per desktop added get_window_feel, get_desktop_look,
	  get_desktop_feel functions
