	* M.-A. DARCHE: - Renamed in the non-configurable/0_feel "Take
	  screen shot" menu entries into:   * Capture window image   *
	  Capture framed window image	* Capture screen image - The order

	  to   wide (screen) focus. This order should be more logical and
	  thus more user   friendly.

2004-12-02  madarche

	* M.-A. DARCHE: - Wording "Capture window + frame image" ->

	  keybindings
	* M.-A. DARCHE: - Added a Maximize key binding - Added menu display
	  on Menu key
	* M.-A. DARCHE: EdgeResistance 800 80 -> EdgeResistance 800 4

	  The previous EdgeResistance setting was really to large for the
	  pixel gap and was a creating the impression of a not-so-fluid
	  window manager.
	* M.-A. DARCHE: CirculateSkipIcons seems a better default (more
	  usable desktop).
	* M.-A. DARCHE: Xzap 12 -> Xzap 2 Yzap 12 -> Yzap 2

	  This change is made to avoid that when doing window wrapping the
	  pointer triggers the display of the tooltip.
	* M.-A. DARCHE: - Added support for Psi (Jabber instant messager)
	  in the database file - Reorganization of the database file by
	  themes

	  their equivalent in shell   scripts using X xwd program +
	  ImageMagick for conversion.  - Made the xlock command really lock

	  it): SmartPlacement RandomPlacement #NoPPosition

2001-07-07  sasha

	* fixed 3D drawing and implemented all 6 modes

2001-07-06  sasha

	* fixed glyph compression again; Started implementing 3D text.
	* Fixed bug in asimage.c where fake_im was not initialized;
	  Corrected glyph compression code
	* asfont fixin
	* fixed layers merging to correctly draw the background layer when
	  image is missing; Fixed spacing calculations, while drawing text

2001-07-05  sasha

	* Temporarily plugged bug in layer merging descovered by allanon,
	  when bottommost layer does not have any image in it.
	* Reimplemented image output to allow for flexible support for many
	  image formats - right now it could be ASImage itself, XImage,
	  mask XImage and  ARGB32.  Surprisingly that simplified code quite
	  abit.  Fixed ugly bug in create_asimage.  Completed and debugged
	  astext tutorial.
	* fixed text size calculations; fixed (almost) bevel drawing  -
	  need to think about what to do with clip_width/height in Layer
	  specs

2001-07-04  sasha

	* fixed lots of bugs in glyph compressing and rendering, still
	  something is wrong with size calculation func. Added
	  move_asimage_channel to swap channels on images

2001-07-03  sasha

	* implemented astext properly
	* implemented asgrad, asflip and astext. Althou astext still needs
	  some work.
	* added prototypes for asflip, asgrad and astext
	  examples/tutorials/testapps to the libAfterIMage suit

2001-07-02  sasha

	* Completed ASMerge implementation. Used it to debug all the
	  merging routines.  Everything works perfect now.  Added
	  doc/html/asmerge.html - another tutorial.  Added
	  list_scanline_merging function to blender.c so that we can show
	  descriptions on different merging methods.
	* Added ASMerge example, and added translator from function name to
	  function for scanline merging/blending.

2001-07-01  sasha

	* added check for xpm.h needing X11/ in front of it; Upgraded
	  version to 1.8.9; rebuild config accoringly.

2001-06-29  sasha

	* Added ASScale and ASTile examples with documentation and stuff.
	  Fixed bug in asimage.c causing artifacts when image is tiled with
	  TOP quality.	cleabed up cvsignore in include/
	* fixed and simplified configure script for examples to
	  libAfterImage. Have a good day :)

2001-06-28  sasha

	* Added documenting comments to asview.c so it generates nice
	  little Tutorial as the result.  Added lots of X functions to xref
	  files, so now all the source code is very nicely crossreferenced.
	  Added references to asview to other headers etc.

2001-06-27  sasha

	* Completed documenting asfont.h Added afterimage.h with library
	  overview got rid of old doc files added freetype and X11 xrefs so
	  that docs are nicely crosslinked with X docs

2001-06-26  sasha

	* asfont.h documentation  50% done
	* added Makefile targets fopr autogeneration of documentation in
	  man and HTML formats. Added installation procedure for those.

2001-06-25  sasha

	* Documented blender.h and import.h - asfont.h to go.  Also it
	  sound like a good idea to add afterimage.h with overview notes
	  about libAfterImage and references to components.

2001-06-24  sasha

	* completed fixing libraries includes
	* rewrote libraries includes generation; fixed freetype checking to
	  skip old garbadge left over in X11R6 dir

2001-06-22  allanon

	*  o installastheme.pl now uses the first screen depth reported by
	  xdpyinfo
	     instead of the last; this fixes problems with the look not
	  updating on
	     XFree86 4.x
	   o removed reference to xiterm from Wharf config file; wharf now
	  tries to
	     load aterm, and then xterm if that fails

2001-06-22  sasha

	* Completed documenting asimage.h and asvisual.h.  asfont.h and
	  import.h to go
	* fixed libAfterImage include to always use -I gcc flag

2001-06-21  sasha

	* MOre documentation writing - ASImage.h is almost done.

2001-06-21  owsla

	* added stop_image_output() to asimage2mask_ximage()
	* change show_system_error() output based on `man perror`

2001-06-21  sasha

	*  got asview to compile cleanly and find all the relevant
	  libraries - need to think about simplifying configure scripts and
	  headers there

2001-06-20  owsla

	* plugged a mem leak, asimage2ximage() wasn't doing
	  stop_image_output() on it's ASImageOutput struct

2001-06-20  sasha

	* asimage.html and asimage.man updates
	* autogenerate man page for asimage.h
	* Implemented proper generation of mask XImage (1bpp)

2001-06-19  sasha

	* more doc
	* Implemented ARGB->pixel conversion for 32 and 24 bit True color
	  visual Fixed parse_argb_color to correctly treat 12 digit color
	  value as 48bit RGB.  More libAfterImage documenting
	* Fixed bug in find_file preventing it from finding files when not
	  NULL search path is specified.  Fixed bug in asimage2pixmap
	  causing it to use wrong gc variable.	Added more documentation to
	  asimage.h and respectively to asimage.html

2001-06-18  sasha

	* Added lots of self documenting comments to
	  libAfterImage/asimage.h to allow for automagic documentation
	  generation using robodoc package. Seems to be the only package
	  that works decently.
	* man pages writing
	* libAfterImage manpages update

2001-06-17  owsla

	* fixed some typos for you Sasha :)

2001-06-17  sasha

	* started implementing sample repository of example libAfterImage
	  apps

2001-06-15  sasha

	* Added prototypes of the man pages for libAfterImage
	* added MMX enabling switch to libAfterImage configure

2001-06-14  sasha

	* Completed Pseudo-color support with colormap allocation and
	  ximage handling.  Added create_asimage and destroy_asimage for
	  convinience.	Added missing stuff to libAfterImage/afterbase.h to
	  make it completely independant.  libAfterImage thus should be
	  ready for release - only to write up some docs :)

2001-06-13  sasha

	* completed flip-flopping code.  Added show_debug to show_* series
	  in libAfterBase/output.c started working on collor allocation on
	  PseudoColor visuals

2001-06-12  sasha

	* completed implementation of image alpha beveling.  completed
	  implementation of image flipping - need some cleanup thou to
	  allow for tiling.

2001-06-11  sasha

	* fixed configure to produce correct dependencies
	*  fixed configure to correctly create dependacy info
	* no message
	* Hopefully fixed memory allocations audit on libAfterBase.
	* Added ASImageBevel to allow for transparent bevelling of images
	  while merging layers.  Hopefully fixed X libs in configure script
	  - need to rerun autoconf
	*  added configclean target to the top level makefile; fixed
	  libraries makefiles to correctly generate .depend files
	*  fixed configure scripts to not do extra checks when invoked from
	  one another

2001-06-10  owsla

	* updated .cvsignore files
	* typo fix in make_file_name

2001-06-10  sasha

	* got rid of old image loading stuff. LoadImageWithMask moved into
	  resources.h and is now simple shortcut to libAfterImage loader

2001-06-09  sasha

	* made test to compile; Fixed several bugs in libAfterImage;
	  optimized 2bpp handling in xpm code; builtin xpm handler is about
	  2 times as fast as libXpm on small images and 5 times on larger
	  ones

2001-06-08  sasha

	* configure fixes
	* updated configure scripts
	* further progress - src/test compiles now, but need to redo
	  libAfterImage/configure
	* fixed compilation bug in import.c
	* rebuilt configure scripts
	* updated configure scripts to reflect addition of the xpm parsing
	  code
	* Completed custom xpm implementation. Needs to be debugged thou.
	* hopefully fixed main configure script to gracefully handle
	  libraries configuration as well. MOved configure.h and some other
	  headers into include dir, so it could be used by modules

2001-06-07  sasha

	* Fixed MyName requests in selfdiag.c; Added xpm.c to implement
	  custom xpm handling code - appears to be rather simple and
	  effective.  Most of the things are implemented, except for top
	  level routine.
	* cleaned configure script for libafterimage. added afterimage-libs
	  script to print list of LD_FLAGS for linking with libafterimage

2001-06-06  sasha

	* fixed bug found by allanon when asimage2ximage would produce
	  black ximage due to unset flags in scanline

2001-06-05  sasha

	* fixed 50% of libAfterStep files to compile.  added functions.c to
	  hold all the function processing miscelanea cleaned up includes
	  on the way.
	* Aggregated module library code into ASmodule.c  - soon to be
	  renamed into module.c.  readaspacket.c, Xmodule.c are now gone.
	  Rewritten packet reading code to use socket_* interface from
	  libAfterBase, with correct endiannes handling of the data - need
	  to fix src/afterstep/module.c too, and maybe move some code from
	  there into libAfterStep/module.c.

2001-06-04  sasha

	* started documenting libAfterImage

2001-06-04  owsla

	* updated configure
	* updated the .cvsignore files

2001-06-04  sasha

	* fixed bug in configure --with-jpeg
	* added missing .depend
	* sorted out compilation problems, and test now builds with new
	  libAfterImage

2001-06-03  sasha

	* got libAfterImage to compile

2001-06-02  sasha

	* hopefully resolved libAfterImage dependancy on libAfterBase

2001-06-01  sasha

	* separated libAfterImage files from the rest of the crowd
	* started up libAfterImage

2001-05-31  sasha

	* forgot to add socket files
	* Implemented libAfterBase/socket.c to perform all the network
	  communication stuff. It implements socket setup, buffered writes
	  of int and string data, effective protocol implementation for
	  non-blocking reading.
	* fixed configure scripts to correctly compile everything

2001-05-30  sasha

	* Prototyped ASRenderer interface
	* completed fixing old lib files to compensate for file relocation.
	  There needs to be something done to Mkaefiles and configure to
	  correctly set up include paths and libraries.

2001-05-29  sasha

	* added output.c to libAfterImage to do all the show_* stuff. added
	  astype.h to define all the basic types fixed most of the files to
	  compile
	* post relocation cleanup in process - several things merged
	  together into fs.c and os.c
	* updated to reflect location change

2001-05-28  sasha

	* Split ASVisual from ScreenInfo and rearranged ARGB32.  Added
	  ASGradient to asimage.h and made gradient_t to be a synonym to
	  it.  That should allow for better library independancy - visual
	  will go with libAfterImage while ScreenInfo will move into
	  libAfterStep , or, possibly will split up even more.	Goal is to
	  make libAfterImage completely independant from everything else.
	* Created prototype for the new library structure - libAfterBase.
	  There will be two more libraries : libAfterImage and
	  libAfterStep. This is to split generic and non-generic code and
	  allow for libraries to be used separately  - as a preparation for
	  libAfterImage release as a stand-alone library.)

2001-05-23  allanon

	* Updated FSF snail mail address.

2001-05-12  sasha

	* added code to check for valid channels while flipping

2001-05-10  sasha

	* Completed gradients drawing code. Started  on flipping code.
	  Added direction reverse to output method.

2001-05-09  sasha

	* Implemented vertical gradient drawing.  sorted out relationship
	  between channel numbering and ARGB32 component order - its the
	  same now.
	* fixed mono line encoding to add zero terminator at the end; fixed
	  scanline back_color initialization to have alpha at 0xFF; fixed
	  decoration layouting to not use stack memory in linked list;
	  fixed property event handler to initialize variable to NULL;
	  Afterstep now starts , althou does not do anything usefull

2001-05-08  sasha

	* coded gradients drawing using ASImages with smoothing and
	  dithering - works very blasted fast.	Fixed numerous include's
	  issues

2001-05-07  sasha

	* fixed create_screen_window for InputOnly windows fixed bug in
	  screen initialization where Colormap ID would get lost fixed bug
	  in desktop creation code where desktop->scr would never get
	  initialized.	Added show_progress function to work similarly to
	  show_warning/error Rearranged thresholds for output verbosity
	  Added stdargs.h  to import.c - suggested by Sean Dague

2001-05-04  sasha

	* completed ASFont implementation as needed at the moment - there
	  will need to be some work done in order to adapt it to locale
	  support.( as well as in several other places).  changed glyph
	  compression algorithm once again to run length encode only 0s and
	  FFs, and store rest in raw format. That allows to cut down on
	  memory since we don't use 2 bytes anymore.  3 step antialiasing
	  works now.  Off to image rotation and gradient drawing.

2001-05-03  sasha

	* Improved glyph compression algorithm so now it actually reduces
	  size, even on ery small fonts.  Tryed to implement additional
	  glyph smoothing, but something is wrong - disabled for now.

2001-05-02  sasha

	* fixed font drawing to group glyphs as close together as possible
	  - make for much nicer effect.
	* debugged X11 fonts loading and drawing. Still need to do
	  something about negative left bearings - ought to really offset a
	  pen to overlap charcters

2001-05-01  sasha

	* Implemented antialiasing for native X  fonts - still needs some
	  debuggin.

2001-04-30  sasha

	* added RLE compression to the font glyph cache.  added character
	  range specification for the font.  added right-to-left writing
	  order on per font basis.

2001-04-27  sasha

	* implemented text drawing using precached TTF fonts -- needs
	  addition of locale support in future.  Fixed image merging to do
	  clipping correctly.  Added image background color
	* fixed freetype headers problems and a bug in font hashing

2001-04-26  sasha

	* started implementing font manager and freetype support
	* moved scanline merging functions into separate file
	* fixed most blending function so not to tresspass alpha channel
	  boundaries. Added tint_scanlines and implemented dissipation

2001-04-25  sasha

	* fixed bug in image loading where piexls would get shifted by one
	  to the right.  added 14 image blending functions - almost
	  matching that of the GIMP's capabilities, except for multiply and
	  divide modes, which I don't see much sense in.  Added
	  RGB->HSV->RGB and RGB->HLS->RGB conversion functions.

2001-04-24  sasha

	* cleaned up output/encoding functionality.  Added quality
	  parameters to dynamically adjust quality on per image basis.
	  Implemented alpha blending and generic layer merging framework.

2001-04-23  sasha

	* debugged tiling functionality and optimized it so not to do
	  repeated compression on the same data. Added compression ratio
	  specification on per image basis.  OPtimized buffer copy to use
	  32bit data transfer. Implemented tinting( as a part of tiling
	  process ).
	* debugging tiler

2001-04-22  sasha

	* added tile_image() - needs debugging
	* ASImageDecoder

2001-04-20  sasha

	* added TIFF import and implemented generic image loading function
	  with search capabilities and subimage loading.  Fixed two more
	  bugs in image scaling.
	* added GIF import filter; added configure code to detect gif and
	  tiff libraries

2001-04-19  sasha

	* .CUR is the same as .ICO only type = 2
	* Added support for .PNM, .PPM, .ICO, .BMP image file formats -
	  TIFF and GIF to go

2001-04-18  sasha

	* xcf image loading now works, but only gets you first layer with
	  the same size as whole image. Need to implement layers merging
	  for ASImages to get complete support for GIMP's xcf files
	* fixed bug in xcf channel loading - theer are no such thing as
	  channel type

2001-04-17  sasha

	* most of the preparation work for xcf reading is done - now off to
	  actually create ASImage from it.  added code to poupulate
	  ASScanline with 0's where data is not available;
	*  minor quality tweaks in rations 1-2 scaling up. Started
	  implementing ASImageDecoder for automatic tinting/tiling

2001-04-16  sasha

	* IMplemented JPEG input filter for ASImage.  Fixed long standing
	  bug in image scaling causing wierdness in scaling UP with small
	  ratios.  Started implemntation of XCF file reader.

2001-04-15  sasha

	* implemented png file reader and fixed blatant bug in scale image
	  up where first line got garbadge in it

2001-04-14  sasha

	* compilation fixes

2001-04-13  sasha

	* Implemented xpm loading into asimage. Updated asimage to
	  correctly use ScreenInfo.  implemented create_screen_pixmap and
	  create_screen_ximage
	* fixed test abit to not spit lots of warnings

2001-04-12  sasha

	* converted asfeel, backgrounds, mywidget, and others to use
	  ScreenInfo.  libafterstep and libasGUI now compiles clean, althou
	  libasGUI will need to be cleaned up to use ASImage for most of
	  the stuff instead of old pixmap based drawing.

2001-04-11  sasha

	* converted mytexture.c to be multyscreen aware - althou when
	  ASImage is done that will have to be switched to use ASImages
	  instead of all the funky Pixmap stuff.  GetColor is no longer
	  needed, GetShadow and GetHilite moved to mystyles.c - get rid of
	  lib/getcolor.c

2001-04-10  sasha

	* multihead support work in progress - colors are internally stored
	  as 32bit ARGB values.  and converted to pixels based on each
	  screen - need to add GC creation code to ScreenInfo code.
	  parse_argb_color is implemented and should be used instead of
	  XParseColor.

2001-04-08  sasha

	* fixed bugs in scaling down code with ratio > 2; It appears that
	  you can create windows with different visual only if you create
	  new colormap and allocate border color from it as well. Fixed
	  screen.c accordingly. We keep black and white pixels and colormap
	  in ScreenInfo now - should use it instead of X macros

2001-04-06  sasha

	* implemented workaround for some stupid X servers that denys you
	  your constitutional right to use whatever Visual you like.
	* couple bugfixes for new visual handling code.  moved
	  ximage->scanline->ximage code from asimage.c to screen.c still
	  need to implement PseudoClor handling
	* hopefully fixed bug in 2x scaling up code

2001-04-05  sasha

	* no message
	* reworked ScreenInfo abit to include visual info.  Added screen.c
	  to libafterstep to collect together all the Screen/display
	  related stuff - ConnectX, MyXErrorHandle, and several new things
	  : init_screen and destroy_screen. nolock_mods has been moved
	  outside of the ScreenInfo as it is per-display and not per-screen
	  stuff. all_screens global variable holds pointers to all
	  ScreenInfo structrures for available screens. Added
	  query_visual_info to try and obtain best possible visual for
	  AfterStep to use. Need to move ximage->as->ximage conversion
	  stuff into screen.c. ConnectX now takes only one parameter -
	  pointer to ScreenInfo is discontinued
	* same old Ximage cleanup

2001-04-04  sasha

	* asimage->ximage debugging again - this time about 50% performance
	  increase.
	* more optimization to ximage output algorithm - that was the last
	  of it I'm sick and tired from this stuff

2001-04-03  sasha

	* Some tweaks to XImage writing code to speed things up - we were
	  spending upto 30% of time writing XImages - unacceptable.
	* fixed bug in line interpolation causing stripy artifacts in
	  scaling up
	* mmx debugged

2001-04-02  sasha

	* Added some MMX inline assembly to image scaling code to hopefully
	  make it faster -  need to verify if that indeed is the case.
	* fix to mystyle drawing as applyed to empty menu drawing
	* aaa

2001-04-01  sasha

	* scaling speed optimizations

2001-03-31  sasha

	* debugged new scaling code - scale up is rather nice even with
	  huge ratio - check out src/test

2001-03-30  sasha

	* Implemented complete scaling Up procedure for arbitrary ratio -
	  if it'll work then similar stuff will go for 1-2 and 2-3 ratios.
	  Added reshape_winlist to WinList to actually generate layout of
	  titlebars based on WinList data and store pointers to them in
	  appropriate place in WMDecor structures. It now needs to be
	  debugged as a prototype for other modules.
	* debugged scaling down algorithm  - it now works and scale things
	  down rather nicely. Thus we have a proof of concept and can
	  proceed on to scaling up - which is mopstly implemented already

2001-03-29  sasha

	* completed implementation of scaling down of ASImages.  Added
	  dithering capabilities to ASImage->XImage conversion to hopefully
	  produce better results on 16bpp and 15bpp Fixed bug in ASWinLIst
	  message processing to create WinList if it did not exist.  Fixed
	  Bug in afterstep to initialize handlers in main window list to
	  correct functions.
	* defined structure of high level scaling API

2001-03-28  sasha

	* Added AS message reading/partiall handling to new WinList.  Moved
	  get_window_* functions into aswinlist.c Changed the way
	  process_message is called - it now takes ASMessage * as a param.
	  Made everything compiling.
	* some theory investigation into up scaling algorithms with
	  smoothing

2001-03-27  sasha

	* the best variant of compression algorithm - average compression
	  ratio is about 75for highly random images(nature) and 30for
	  regular images (naked body, etc.); no off to more exciting things

2001-03-26  sasha

	* no message
	* fixed compression code

2001-03-24  owsla

	* removed static keyword from libasimage_decode_line, this was
	  preventing it from being exported in the lib, which made the test
	  program fail

2001-03-23  sasha

	* optimized asimage decompression algorithm scaling down algorithm
	  implemented/.
	* extensive asimage debugging - compression now seems to work fine

2001-03-22  sasha

	* Completed implementation of Pixmap->ASImage->Pixmap cycle Now off
	  to debugging and implementing of scaling/alpha-blending/etc.
	* added timeouts to asetroot for displaying window; added
	  flush_wmprops_data to remove specifyed properties - updated
	  asetroot to use it. fixed rather nasty bug in asvector causing
	  memory corruption in modules code; Fixed error handling in
	  LoadImage

2001-03-21  sasha

	* Fixed module connection code to corrently use WMProps to get
	  socket filename.  Fixed afterstep initialization to setup modules
	  only after WMProps initialized.
	* Updated asetroot to use ASWMProps for background property
	  reading/writing.  Added even handler to wmprops.c to handle
	  property change events for root and selection windows - need to
	  do the same for client properties as well ( maybe?) .  Added
	  set_as_background to wmprops.c for asetroot to use.  Added
	  set_client_names and set_client_hints to clientprops.c for use by
	  modules.  Added set_text_property to facilitate conversion into
	  UTF8 of text properties where needed.  Added encode_atom_list to
	  allow for easy translation from bitset into atom list.  Updated
	  asetroot to use new set_client_* functions for hints. ( it now is
	  Extended WM specs compliant as needed).

2001-03-20  sasha

	* Fixed Cursor grabbing code to use correct cursor IDs.  Fixed
	  auditing code to not count memory cached in freed pool.  Added
	  destruction code for LayoutDef.  Fixed default DecorLayouts to
	  put things in the right places.  Numerous fixes in LayoutDef
	  generation code.  Window decorations seems to be correct now.
	  Added checks to several places in mystyles to check for non-zero
	  pixmap size.	There still is wierd bug in menuwindow causing X
	  errors on menu close.
	* fixed several memory corruption bugs in myicon_create,
	  mylook_init and ashash. Added flush_ashash_memory_pool to free up
	  memory so that audit shows relevant data. added cleanup_mode to
	  audit to disable invalid opointer reports (if needed)

2001-03-19  sasha

	* hmm, catching bugs in new layout code - making progress - AS now
	  segfaults due to some obscure memory corruption. :)

2001-03-13  sasha

	* Improved owsla's fix to counter bug - xdestroyimage should not
	  really be deallocating NULL memory

2001-03-11  owsla

	* Fixed bug that caused Total deallocs to be higher than Total
	  allocs, this happened because count_find_and_extract() did not
	  have an alternative if remove_hash_item() failed.
	* Added a pretty line break in spool_unfreed_mem()

2001-03-08  sasha

2001-03-06  sasha

	* almost done with ornament layout generation code - smaller part
	  of frame layout left.  reverted ASHashKey back to unsigned short
	  - when it was changed to unsigned int - no idea.

2001-02-22  sasha

	* Fixed crashing bugs in aswindow.c(restack_window()) and
	  Xmodule.c( My_XErrorHandler()) Standardized titlebar
	  resizing/respacing functions and now use it in both WMIcon and
	  WMDecor.  Fixed icons being black on second inocification -
	  needed to resize layouts in fix_icon_size.  Icon title now is
	  drawn not smaller then icon itself.

2001-02-15  sasha

	* Completed implementation of function validation in asfeel.c;
	  Fixed cursor grabbing in ExecuteComplexFunction to use actuall
	  cursor ID instead on number.	Supposedly got icon
	  mapping/unmapping right this time.  Iconification/deiconification
	  actually works now, but fails on reentry - i.e.
	  iconify->deiconify->iconify - needs some more debugging.  Fixed
	  memory corruption in winlist menu.

2001-02-14  sasha

	* playing with mywmicon and widgets.  Implmented event bubbling up
	  to higher level widgets if not handled by a widget.  Implemented
	  some memory conservation when allocating memory for
	  MyLayourElems.  Implemented memory preallocation caching for
	  ASHashItem.

2001-02-01  sasha

	* extensive debugging of window initial mapping and subsequent
	  withdrawal.  Windows are now decorated and destroyed correctly.
	  Multiple reparenting/ messaging/destruction bugs fixed. Placement
	  fixed when window is decorated after AS startup and is using
	  USPosition.  Menus needs some debugging.
	* event debugging

2001-01-30  sasha

	* Added mystrdup/mystrndup to memory audit code, since they are so
	  generic; Fixed memory leaks in asdatabase.c(match_list),
	  Feel.c(key binding and EdgeScroll), CaptureAllWindows
	  (read_32prop_list), few other places. Implemented cleanup
	  procedures for all the static data (aswindows.c, clientprops.c,
	  modules.c, wmprops.c,mystyles.c); Fixed workspace session saving
	  code to correctly recognize and workaround geometry. AfterSTep
	  has no visible memory leaks as of now.

2001-01-29  sasha

	* removed config reading from the pipe - was causing some compile
	  time problems, and updated README.nl
	* Changed memory audit to use hash tables instead of linked list -
	  its blazing fast now. Added add_hash_item to memory audit
	  recognizeable functions - makes it much more usefull. Need to do
	  the same for strdup functions.

2001-01-28  sasha

	* Drawing in spaces between titlebar and client is fixed - new
	  option BorderColor has to be added to MyStyles. Several memory
	  leaks fixed - in menus, destruction of disabled elements in
	  mywidgets, etc.

2001-01-26  sasha

	* nailed down this memory corruption bug - VECTOR_TAIL was not
	  working very good - forgot to multiply by unit size. Now lets fnd
	  out with this huge number of pipes in linux 2.4 - 1024 - event
	  loop has to be rewritten to yield sufficient performance there

2001-01-25  sasha

	* Side/lowbar is now appearing. Manhunt is underway for some nasty
	  memory leak bug causing memory allocations of some random (very
	  large) sizes.  Added print_mem_stats_info to audit.c to enable
	  output of short version of memory allocation status.
	* Fixed initial placement of clients; Fixed initial layer. Fixed X
	  errors on initial feel load;

2001-01-24  sasha

	* finally got frame decoration to draw - topmost frame was never
	  mapped.  improved abit decor initialization code to avoid
	  redundand calculations.  Fixed bug in afterstep main to change
	  desktop correctly when AS is restarted
	* updated debugging log
	* Fixed memory audition for new property reading/allocation
	  functions : XListProperties, XGetTextProperty, XAllocClassHint,
	  XAllocSizeHints; added LOCAL_DEBUG_CALLER_OUT macro to enable
	  runtime caller backtracing.

2001-01-21  sasha

	*  implemented ASHints serialization - need to implement
	  decerealization next.

2001-01-18  sasha

	* Implemeted Circulation/warping code.	Some more cleanup in
	  functions.c.

2001-01-16  sasha

	* Updated DeferExecution to use ASEvent and cleaned up a bit;
	  Changed ExecFunction to use ASEvent - still alot to do here.
	  Changed check_allowed_menu_func to use mask as an argument
	  instead of ASWindow pointer.	Fixed SaveOpenedWindows in
	  afterstep.c.	changed spawn_child to not add & at the end of
	  cmdline if requested to not fork.  Made KeyboardShortcuts to
	  compile.  Disabled most of the event handlers to not participate
	  in compile for now.  Fixed colormaps.c to use ASEvent.  Added
	  match_string_list to regexp.c.  Added pattern2ASWindow to
	  aswindow.c to facilitate pattern matching of window names.

2001-01-12  sasha

	* Got desktop.c to compile.  Added set_desktop_num_prop and
	  set_current_desk_prop to wmprops.c to facilitate updates of all
	  those pesky compatibility properties on root window.	Added
	  set_client_state and set_client_desk in clientprops.c to enable
	  update of the window state properties as per Gnome and ExtWM
	  specs.  Added change_window_state() to aswindow.c to provide
	  unified interface to changing window status.	Moved
	  Reparent/Map/UnmapIt to aswindow.c and renamed them to be
	  reparent_window, map_window, unmap_window - seems to be more
	  consistent.  Updated hints and clientprops to latest ExtWM specs
	  - ICON_NAME and SKIP_PAGER added.  Started cleaning up events.c

2001-01-10  sasha

	* fixed bug in hash table sorting, that was causing endless looping
	  and out-of-bounds memory access

2001-01-07  sasha

	* implemented singleton launcher in lib/asapp. Switched background
	  drawing and sound playing to use it.

2001-01-04  sasha

	* some more afterstep.c cleanup.  Added set_as_module_socket to
	  wmprops.c Removed get_virtual_root from Xmodule.c - should use
	  wmprops now.	minor cleanup of src/afterstep/module.c - needs way
	  more work.
	* implemented ASWMProps strructure and some essential reading
	  procedures.  asproperty is gone and code is consolidated with
	  xprop.c/.h

2001-01-03  sasha

	* implemented selections mechnismus.  Implemented some Window
	  Manager compatibility properties added property writing functions
	  to xprop.c

2001-01-02  sasha

	* added forgotten xprop.c to Makefile
	* some more development in afterstep.c - spawining children is
	  updated.  Rearranged hints/properties in libafterstep to allow
	  for more modular approach - properties on client windows are
	  separated from the properties on root window.  All the string
	  code consolidated into mystring.c.  Gort rid of CatString3 and
	  CopyString.  Implemented MakeSessionDataFile to build filenames
	  of icons, etc. in ASCP.

2000-12-28  sasha

	* Added automated check for -V command line parameter to ASModule.c
	  for use by modules

2000-12-27  sasha

	* completed session saving into file code - Window Maker sucks!
	  rearranged CaptureAllWindows.  add_window now allows to add
	  window based on its WM_STATE.
	* fixed print_simple_backtrace to work around buggy gcc. Got rid of
	  wild.c - moved into regexp.c

2000-12-26  sasha

	* Implemented show_error/warning and DEBUG_OUT/LOCAL_DEBUG_OUT.
	  Implemented stack backtracing from failed X calls without
	  signals.  Converted old code in libasGUI to use new output
	  routines.  Compilation problem fixed related to removal of
	  misc.h.

2000-12-21  sasha

	* renamed ShutDown.xpm to shutdown2.xpm
	* restacking developments
	* added -fPIC

2000-12-14  sasha

	* ChangeLog and configure fixed for the new version
	* Some new basic ASWindow evelopment
	* ASVector developed and tested - seems to be working just fine.
	* Removed short term memory allocation code since it is useless
	  anyways and was causing some compilation problems on older
	  compilers.
	* socket fix to make AS 1.8 work with CYGWIN under Windows NT/9x

2000-12-13  sasha

	* dynamic_buffer changed to ASVector with the goal to make it more
	  general purpose and use in different places. Started work on
	  ASWindowList

2000-12-12  sasha

	* completed transition to libasGUI. King is dead - Long Live The
	  King
	* libasimage has been renamed to libasGUI

2000-12-11  sasha

	* Exposure and ConfigureNotify handling is correct now. Fixed bugs
	  in MyLookInit and CheckPixmapCache.

2000-12-08  sasha

	* Debugged stanradr decoration layouting; Fixed rotation of the
	  icons; Added option for each text letter to be rotated
	  individually

2000-12-06  sasha

	* Assorted debugging

2000-11-27  sasha

	* Libraries compile, but BackPixmap needs debugging

2000-11-23  owsla

	* _'s fixed

2000-11-22  owsla

	* when we check for isalnum() make sure we check for ispunct() as
	  well

2000-11-17  sasha

	* completely implemented new ASFeel utilization. Still needs work
	  to implement autoexec execution. Got rid of all the old config
	  reading crap

2000-11-16  sasha

	* Keyboard and Mouse bindings fixin. There could be several
	  bindings for the same context for the single control - but with
	  different mods. That forces us to alter algorithm used
	  previously. But indeed it turned out to be more memory intensive,
	  but easier to code approach.

2000-11-13  sasha

	* Applying ASFeel to afterstep

2000-11-07  sasha

	* Keyboard and Mouse bindings parsing implemented

2000-11-02  sasha

	  standard menu, fixed menu.  Imlemented menu loading for ASFeel
	  added asfeel.c file to libafterstep Definied data structures to
	  hold keyboard and mouse bindings Moved is_executable_in_path to
	  libafterstep Hopefully fixed look/feel changing and different
	  looks/feels per desktop added get_window_feel, get_desktop_look,
	  get_desktop_feel functions
