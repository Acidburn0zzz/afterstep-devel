2001-05-28  sashav
		Split ASVisual from ScreenInfo and rearranged ARGB32.
		Added ASGradient to asimage.h and made gradient_t to be a synonym to it.
		That should allow for better library independancy - visual will go with libAfterImage
		while ScreenInfo will move into libAfterStep , or, possibly will split up even more.

2001-05-04  sashav
		completed ASFont implementation as needed at the moment - there will need to be some
		work done in order to adapt it to locale support.( as well as in several other places).
		changed glyph compression algorithm once again to run length encode only 0s and
		FFs, and store rest in raw format. That allows to cut down on memory since we
		don't use 2 bytes anymore.
		3 step antialiasing works now.
		Off to image rotation and gradient drawing.

2001-05-03  sashav

		now it actually reduces size, even on ery small fonts.
		Tryed to implement additional glyph smoothing, but something is wrong - disabled for now.

2001-05-02  sashav
		fixed font drawing to group glyphs as close together as possible - make for much
		nicer effect.

		left bearings - ought to really offset a pen to overlap charcters

2001-05-01  sashav
		Implemented antialiasing for native X  fonts - still needs some
		debuggin.

2001-04-30  sashav

2001-04-27  sashav
		implemented text drawing using precached TTF fonts -- needs addition of
		locale support in future.
		Fixed image merging to do clipping correctly.
		Added image background color

		fixed freetype headers problems and a bug in font hashing

2001-04-26  sashav
		moved scanline merging functions into separate file

		fixed most blending function so not to tresspass alpha channel
		boundaries. Added tint_scanlines and implemented dissipation

		started implementing font manager and freetype support

2001-04-25  sashav
		fixed bug in image loading where piexls would get shifted by one to the right.
		added 14 image blending functions - almost matching that of the GIMP's
		capabilities, except for multiply and divide modes, which I don't see much sense in.
		Added RGB->HSV->RGB and RGB->HLS->RGB conversion functions.

2001-04-24  sashav
		cleaned up output/encoding functionality.
		Added quality parameters to dynamically adjust quality on per image basis.
		Implemented alpha blending and generic layer merging framework.

2001-04-23  sashav
		debugging tiler

		debugged tiling functionality and optimized it so not to do repeated compression
		on the same data. Added compression ratio specification on per image basis.
		OPtimized buffer copy to use 32bit data transfer. Implemented tinting( as a part of tiling process ).

		added tile_image() - needs debugging

2001-04-22  sashav
		ASImageDecoder

2001-04-20  sashav
		added TIFF import and implemented generic image loading function with
		search capabilities and subimage loading.
		Fixed two more bugs in image scaling.

		added GIF import filter; added configure code to detect gif and
		tiff libraries

2001-04-19  sashav
		Added support for .PNM, .PPM, .ICO, .BMP image file formats -
		TIFF and GIF to go

		.CUR is the same as .ICO only type = 2

2001-04-18  sashav
		xcf image loading now works, but only gets you first layer with the same size as
		whole image. Need to implement layers merging for ASImages to get complete
		support for GIMP's xcf files

		fixed bug in xcf channel loading - theer are no such thing as
		channel type

2001-04-17  sashav
		most of the preparation work for xcf reading is done -
		now off to actually create ASImage from it.
		added code to poupulate ASScanline with 0's where data is not available;

		minor quality tweaks in rations 1-2 scaling up. Started
		implementing ASImageDecoder for automatic tinting/tiling

2001-04-16  sashav
		IMplemented JPEG input filter for ASImage.
		Fixed long standing bug in image scaling causing wierdness in scaling UP with
		small ratios.
		Started implemntation of XCF file reader.

2001-04-15  sashav
		implemented png file reader and fixed blatant bug in scale
		image up where first line got garbadge in it

2001-04-14  sashav
		compilation fixes

2001-04-13  sashav
		Implemented xpm loading into asimage. Updated asimage to correctly use ScreenInfo.
		implemented create_screen_pixmap and create_screen_ximage

		fixed test abit to not spit lots of warnings

2001-04-08  sashav
		fixed bugs in scaling down code with ratio > 2; It appears that
		you can create windows with different visual only if you create
		new colormap and allocate border color from it as well. Fixed
		screen.c accordingly. We keep black and white pixels and
		colormap in ScreenInfo now - should use it instead of X macros

2001-04-06  sashav
		hopefully fixed bug in 2x scaling up code

		implemented workaround for some stupid X servers that denys you your constitutional
		right to use whatever Visual you like.

		couple bugfixes for new visual handling code.
		moved ximage->scanline->ximage code from asimage.c to screen.c
		still need to implement PseudoClor handling

2001-04-05  sashav
		same old Ximage cleanup

		reworked ScreenInfo abit to include visual info.
		Added screen.c to libafterstep to collect together
		all the Screen/display related stuff - ConnectX, MyXErrorHandle,
		and several new things : init_screen and destroy_screen. nolock_mods
		has been moved outside of the ScreenInfo as it is per-display and not per-screen
		stuff. all_screens global variable holds pointers to all ScreenInfo structrures for
		available screens. Added query_visual_info to try and obtain best possible
		visual for AfterStep to use. Need to move ximage->as->ximage conversion stuff
		into screen.c. ConnectX now takes only one parameter - pointer to ScreenInfo is discontinued

2001-04-04  sashav
		asimage->ximage debugging again - this time about 50% 
		performance increase.

		more optimization to ximage output algorithm - that was the
		last of it I'm sick and tired from this stuff

2001-04-03  sashav
		fixed bug in line interpolation causing stripy artifacts in
		scaling up

		Some tweaks to XImage writing code to speed things up - we were spending
		upto 30% of time writing XImages - unacceptable.

		mmx debugged

2001-04-02  sashav
		aaa

		Added some MMX inline assembly to image scaling code to hopefully make it faster -
		 need to verify if that indeed is the case.

2001-04-01  sashav
		scaling speed optimizations

2001-03-31  sashav
		debugged new scaling code - scale up is rather nice even with
		huge ratio - check out src/test

2001-03-30  sashav
		debugged scaling down algorithm  - it now works and scale
		things down rather nicely. Thus we have a proof of concept and
		can proceed on to scaling up - which is mopstly implemented already

		Implemented complete scaling Up procedure for arbitrary ratio - if it'll
		work then similar stuff will go for 1-2 and 2-3 ratios.
		Added reshape_winlist to WinList to actually generate layout of titlebars based
		on WinList data and store pointers to them in appropriate place in WMDecor
		structures. It now needs to be debugged as a prototype for other modules.

2001-03-29  sashav
		completed implementation of scaling down of ASImages.
		Added dithering capabilities to ASImage->XImage conversion to hopefully
		produce better results on 16bpp and 15bpp
		Fixed bug in ASWinLIst message processing to create WinList if it did not exist.
		Fixed Bug in afterstep to initialize handlers in main window list to correct functions.

		defined structure of high level scaling API

2001-03-28  sashav
		some theory investigation into up scaling algorithms with smoothing

		Added AS message reading/partiall handling to new WinList.
		Moved get_window_* functions into aswinlist.c
		Changed the way process_message is called - it now takes ASMessage * as a param.
		Made everything compiling.

2001-03-27  sashav
		the best variant of compression algorithm - average compression
		ratio is about 75for highly random images(nature) and 30for
		regular images (naked body, etc.); no off to more exciting things

2001-03-26  sashav
		fixed compression code

2001-03-24  owsla
		removed static keyword from libasimage_decode_line, this was preventing it
		from being exported in the lib, which made the test program fail

2001-03-23  sashav
		optimized asimage decompression algorithm
		scaling down algorithm implemented/.

		extensive asimage debugging - compression now seems to work fine

2001-03-22  sashav
		Completed implementation of Pixmap->ASImage->Pixmap cycle
		Now off to debugging and implementing of scaling/alpha-blending/etc.

2000-12-12  sashav
		libasimage has been renamed to libasGUI

2000-09-18  sashav
		make_indent

2000-05-15  sashav
		asImageFromXImageTest
