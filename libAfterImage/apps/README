This directory contains 7 examples of what libAfterImage can do.
This examples are not built automagically, since most users are not 
likely to need these. They are intended for developers primarily.

Here is how to build examples in this directory :

All of the examples require that libAfterImage is built first.
As libAfterImage may utilize libAfterBase, for some of the low level 
tasks, it is recommended to build libAfterBase prior to anything 
else. After that libAfterImage has to be built and installed.
Both of the above steps can be accomplished by simply doing :

  ./configure ; make ; make install

in respective directory.
Once both libraries are installed we can proceed to compiling
the examples. Top do that you will need to execute :

  ./configure ; make
  
in this directory. Easy. That should build all the examples.

If something goes wrong and you need to update your system and 
repeat above commands, don't forget to remove config.cache, prior 
to running configure script.

All the examples accept command line parameters, and description
of those can be obtained by running example with -h option.
Arguments are not required, and examples should display some 
sensible defaults. 

This set of examples comes with 3 test images and 1 TTF font 
file. Defaults are set to use this files. 

Note that you will not be able to see TTF font rendered if you do 
not have FreeType library version 2 installed.

Thanks for using libAfterImage. Contributions and bug reports are 
always welcome. Please e-mail yours to <sashav at sprintmail dot com>,
or any of the AfterStep mailing lists.


ascompose
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ascompose uses an XML input file to compose an image and display it.  The 
possible XML tags are:

<composite type="alphablend">
  type     Required.  The compositing operation.  Valid values are the 
           standard AS blending ops: add, alphablend, allanon, colorize, 
           darken, diff, dissipate, hue, lighten, overlay, saturate, 
           screen, sub, tint, value.
  All images surrounded by this tag will be composited with the given type.
<scale width="512" height="384">
  width    Required.  The image will be scaled to this width.
  height   Required.  The image will be scaled to this height.
  This tag applies to the first image contained within the tag.  Any 
  further images will be discarded.  
<tile width="512" height="384">
  width    Required.  The image will be tiled to this width.
  height   Required.  The image will be tiled to this height.
  This tag applies to the first image contained within the tag.  Any 
  further images will be discarded.  
<img src=rose512.jpg/>
  src      Required.  The filename (NOT URL) of the image file to load.

As an example, the default XML used by ascompose is:

  <composite type=hue>
    <composite type=add>
      <scale width=512 height=384><img src=rose512.jpg/></scale>
      <tile width=512 height=384><img src=back.xpm/></tile>
    </composite>
    <tile width=512 height=384><img src=fore.xpm/></tile>
  </composite>

To see what this does, run "ascompose --verbose", and it will tell you 
what it is doing at each rendering step.
