<para>Specifies that a gradient should be used as a background instead of a
solid color. The gradient colors start at <emphasis remap='I'>color1</emphasis> and end at
<emphasis remap='I'>colorN</emphasis>. Each color has an <emphasis remap='I'>offset</emphasis> associated with it. The
<emphasis remap='I'>offset</emphasis> is a number between 0.0 and 1.0, and specifies where in
the gradient the colors are to be placed.  The colors are standard X11
color definitions. At least two colors must be given. The offsets are
non-decreasing numbers between 0.0 and 1.0. If the first offset is not
0.0, it will be set to 0.0. If the last offset is not 1.0, it will be
set to 1.0. <emphasis remap='I'>type</emphasis> may be any of the following:</para>

<literallayout remap='.nf'>
6: diagonal from top-left to bottom-right
7: diagonal from bottom-left to top-right
8: top to bottom
9: left to right
